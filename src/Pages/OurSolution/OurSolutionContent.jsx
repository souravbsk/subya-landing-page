          At Sabhyasha we are igniting a revolution in the heart of India's
          artisanal community. Our solution - Artisans Wizard - a user-friendly
          mobile application, crafted on the innovative ONDC framework by the
          Government of India, is a beacon of hope for artisans who have long
          been secluded from the digital marketplace. This app is more than a
          tool; it's a lifeline that connects the intricate craftsmanship of
          India's remote artisans to the vast expanse of the global market.

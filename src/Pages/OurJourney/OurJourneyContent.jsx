          In the heart of Orissa, a land celebrated for its mesmerizing arts and
          crafts, the idea of <strong>*Sabhyasha Retail Tech Pvt. Ltd.*</strong>{" "}
          was born. In 2020, amidst the rich tapestry of Patta Chitra paintings,
          Saura art, intricate Palmleaf works, mesmerizing Sand Art, and
          exquisite Metal, Silver Filigree, Stone, and Wooden Carvings,{" "}
          <strong>*Sasank Sekhar Patro*</strong>, our founder, embarked on a
          transformative journey. His vision was clear: to bring the "Best Kept
          Secret" of Orissa - its local handicrafts - into the limelight,
          celebrated far and wide.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-8 text-justify">
          Sabhyasha began as a beacon of hope and empowerment for the local
          artisans, who are the true architects of India’s cultural fabric.
          Sasank, deeply connected to his roots in Orissa, understood the
          artisans' struggles and their undervalued artistry. He saw the gap
          left by government efforts in truly uplifting these artisans. Hindered
          by middlemen, their talents often remained cloistered within village
          borders.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-8 text-justify">
          This venture wasn’t merely a business; it was a crusade to change the
          destiny of India’s artisanal community. <strong>*Sabhyasha*</strong>{" "}
          envisioned a future where artisans weren’t reliant solely on trade
          fairs, where geographical barriers didn’t limit prosperity, and where
          their craft was accessible to admirers both in India and globally.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-8 text-justify">
          Thus, on 7th March 2022,{" "}
          <strong>*Sabhyasha Retail Tech Pvt. Ltd.*</strong> was incorporated,
          marking the beginning of a journey more significant than just
          corporate success – a movement. It symbolized the bridging of gaps
          between artisans’ workbenches and the global market, leveraging
          digital and technological prowess to intertwine traditional artistry
          with modern commerce. This initiative was about crafting a
          sustainable, vibrant future for India's craftsmen and women, ensuring
          their skills, stories, and legacies thrived.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-8 text-justify">

          and impact. On 20th March 2022, Sabhyasha registered with Startup
